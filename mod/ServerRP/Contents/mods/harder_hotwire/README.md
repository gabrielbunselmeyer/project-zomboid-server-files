# harder_hotwire
Project Zomboid mod that makes hotwiring cars harder.
## Description
This mod is mostly useful for multiplayer when cars are enabled.  
Current vanilla skill level requirements of 1 Electrical and 2 Mechanics can be gained with perks from the very start, so many newcomers to servers can hotwire and take others' cars without significant effort.  
As a bonus the mod has an ability to revert damage done to the cars and even craft a key if your skills are high enough.

**Compatibility:** `40.43`
## New Skill Requirements
### Hotwire
* Metalworking: 1;
* Electronics: 4;
* Mechanics: 6;
* Time: 200.

Metalworking is now required in addition to upped Electrical and Mechanics levels as a person should be able to at least know his way with metal to open ignition in most cases.
### Un-hotwire
* Metalworking: 4;
* Electronics: 6;
* Mechanics: 8;
* Time: 900.

Increased requirements. You should not only be able to revert the damage done to electrical circuits, but also put the lock back in place and weld it all together.
### Craft Car Key
* Metalworking: 8;
* Electronics: 10;
* Mechanics: 10;
* Time: 2100.

Overkill? Maybe. But consider that each player now can craft keys if they pass the checks and even become a key dealer on the server - a feature that only administrator could do previously.
