id=VanillaFoodExtension
description=This is a mod consists of food recipes. Would you like to make chocolatechip cookies? Peanutbutter Sandwich? Cupcakes? Fries? Pizza? Or even canning your own produce? Make your own jerky? Ferment your own Wine? ... Look no further! This mod offers recipes for most, if not all originally none craftable food items! While creating this mod, I have treid to make nutritional value of the ingredients match with the final product to be best of my ability, and hunger dedection is also an important factor which I kept in mind. I have tried to apply common sense with my creation. Most of the recipes also have skill requirements added so it is not too OP, but still challenging and fun:) You will be able to add this mod to your existing save files or any new saves. Since it only uses vanilla items it should not create problems for you. However a backup of your save file is always recommended. Please let me know if you have any suggestions/ideas for more recipes to add with vanilla ingredients!
